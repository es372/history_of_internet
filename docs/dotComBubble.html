                    In the mid- to late-’90s, society’s expectations of what the Internet could offer were unrealistic. From individual dreamers to major corporations, Internet entrepreneurs were infatuated with dreams of becoming dot-com millionaires. These entrepreneurs were inspired by companies like Amazon and eBay. Of course, for every company that grew to be a multi-million dollar business, hundreds of others failed. Many investors ignored the fundamental rules of investing in the stock market, such as analyzing P/E ratios, studying market trends, and reviewing business plans. Instead, investors and entrepreneurs became preoccupied with new ideas that were not yet proven to have market potential.

                    The stock market index, which included many Internet-based companies, peaked in value on March 10, 2000 before crashing. This crash was due to venture capitalists ignoring the rules of investing into start-ups. The burst of the economic bubble during this time is also known as the dot-com crash. It lasted from March 11, 2000 to October 9, 2002. During the crash, many online shopping companies, such as Pets.com, Webvan, Boo.com, Worldcom, NorthPoint Communications and Global Crossing failed and shut down. Others, such as Cisco, whose stock declined by 86%, and Qualcomm, lost a large portion of their market capitalization but survived, and some companies, such as eBay and Amazon declined in value but recovered quickly.
