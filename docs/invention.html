                        So many people today use the internet. This expansive and ever-evolving technology cannot be credited to just one person. Many scientists, programmers, and engineers all contributed to develop new features and technologies that eventually led to the creation of this “information superhighway” we know today.

                    <h1 class="display-5">The ARPAnet</h1>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        After “The Sputnik Scare'', when the soviet union launched the first manmade satellite, America believed that the soviets were going to win the cold war. The U.S. feared that just one missile could destroy the nation’s telephone system of lines and wires that made efficient long-distance communication possible.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        In 1962, a solution to the problem was proposed;  a “galactic network” of computers that could talk to one another. Such a network would enable government leaders to communicate even if the Soviets destroyed the telephone system. Three years later in 1965, contributors developed a way of sending information from one computer to another. This method was called “Packet Switching. Packet switching involves breaking data down into blocks, or packets, before sending it to its destination. Without packet switching, the government's computer network would have been just as vulnerable as the nation’s telephone system.

                    <h1 class="display-5">The World Wide Web</h1>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        A computer programmer in Switzerland named Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web: an internet that was not simply a way to send files from one place to another but was itself a “web” of information that anyone on the Internet could retrieve. Tim Berners-Lee created the Internet that we know today. In 1992, a group of researchers and students developed the first sophisticated browser known as Mosaic. This new browser offered a user-friendly way to search the Web. It allowed users to see words and pictures on the same page for the first time and to navigate using scrollbars and clickable links. This then opened the door to limitless possibilities.
