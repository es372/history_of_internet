                    In 1993, the web exploded and all businesses including; universities, governments, and private corporations all saw huge opportunities in the open web. However, everyone needed new computer software to access it. The only available browser at the time was Mosaic. One year later in 1994, computer scientist Marc Adreessen founded “Netscape Navigator”, a new browser, and released it to the public. Navigator was widely successful and the first browser for the people. By 1995, Microsoft built their own window to the web called “Internet Explorer”.Thus, this release led to the era of browser wars where Netscape and Microsoft tried to outdo the other with faster and better products.

                    Javascript was created by Netscape, and this gave websites powerful computing capabilities that they previously did not possess. Microsoft countered with the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which had become the standard for web page styling and design. In 1997, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4.0 and started shipping it with their Windows operating systems. This led to Microsoft obtaining  99% of the market by 1999. However, Netscape wasn’t out of the game just yet. As a result, Netscape decided to opensource its codebase and founded the non-for-profit “Mozilla”, which later release “Firefox” in 2002. By 2010, Mozilla Firefox and others had reduced Internet Explorer’s Market share by 50%.

                    Other competitors emerged during the late ‘90s and early 2000s, including Opera, Safari, and Google Chrome. Microsoft Edge had replaced Internet Explorer with the release of Windows 10 in 2015. Fortunately, the people today are left with a  handful of ways to access the internet. It seems that this browser war is a good thing for the internet and the people.
